This is a test project to demonstrate Apache Flink based CEP processing to identify patterns from a source, in this case , a csv file which simulates having trasactions. Once a specific pattern is identified and matches a criteria, an alert is generated. 

Future versions will include more complex sources, patterns and alerts.
